# 🚀 Placement Prep – DSA & SQL Solutions

Welcome to my **DSA, Problem-Solving & SQL Repository**!  
This repo contains my solutions to problems from **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**, and other competitive programming platforms. All solutions are coded in **C++** and **SQL**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

I am using this repository to:

- Practice **Data Structures & Algorithms** efficiently.  
- Solve **SQL / MySQL query problems** for database interview prep.  
- Prepare for **product-based company placements**.  
- Keep a well-organized record of my problem-solving journey.  
- Share my solutions with the community for learning and reference.

🌟 Motivation

"Practice isn’t the thing you do once you’re good. It’s the thing you do that makes you good."
— Malcolm Gladwell

✅ **Updates I made:**  
1. Added a new `SQL/` folder in your repo structure with subtopics like Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries, AdvancedQueries.  
2. Added **LeetCode SQL** in Platforms Covered.  
3. Highlighted the purpose and features of solving SQL problems.  
4. Polished readability and formatting.  

If you want, I can also **add a cool badge section** at the top of your README (like LeetCode, GFG, GitHub stats) to make it look more professional.  

Do you want me to do that?
